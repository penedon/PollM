# PollM

PollM is a real-time web app built on **Node.js**, **Socket.IO** and **jQuery**. The app can create polls and generate a 4-char word code that will be used to access the polls. After entering the poll, the user can make his choice. However, he cannot vote more than on choice due to the app's block by IP.

This is a personal project and has no commercial use.

## How to Use

##### Build:

    git clone

    npm start

I want to thank [Kris Olszewski](https://github.com/KrisOlszewski/donut-chart) for his donut-chart, which I modified to display the results of the polls.
